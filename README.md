I've stored the many scripts I've used to create visualizations with MLB data from [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/) using the [baseballr](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/index.html) package.

I focused on making visuals that analyze the performance of the Mariners (duh I'm a Mariners fan).

Here is an example of Paul Sewald's pitching heat map.
